# kaggle
kaggle contains the collection of notebooks used for my various Kaggle competition submissions. Data and models are not included for space reasons but all competition folders contain a data.sh script in their data folder that can be used to download the data provided the kaggle API is installed. All notebooks should flow linearly and running through the entire notebook should create and train a model and finally run that model against the test dataset.

## Acknowledgements
The majority of these models were built using the [FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library and [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org) so a big thanks to both of those teams for building such great products!
